        Audio Visual Technology
    </h1>
    <h2>
Audio Visual Technology is used in almost every field of business. This technology has everything to do with audio (hear) and visual (sight). AV refers to the actual equiment used that convery these components for example speakers, microphones, and projectors.
    </h2>
   <p> Audio Visual technology helps service many businesses with necessary equipment to succed in every visual and audio aspect. This technology is responsible for running and programming all the screens, speakers, and microphones wherever they need to to be assembled. This technology is vital for a lot of businesses and you can often see most of this technology in conference rooms.
</p>
    <p>
        In these conference rooms this is where the converging, emerging, and disruptive technologies can be found. As converging technology is unrelated technologies often brought into a single device, a prime example would be the control panels on the desks. These panels allow for the user to start calls, turn on monitors, and control the cameras and speakers. Emerging technology within the conference rooms could be the cameras that are connected to the microphones and can actually zoom in and out on who is talking while these conference calls are being held. The only real disruptive form of technology are the completely virtual calls which keeps people out of the office and conference rooms.</p>

       Below are listed the six forms of IT content areas,
1) Hardware,
2) Software,
3) Internet Technologies 
4) Networking,
5) Programming,
6) Databases 
        Cenero does a great deal with hardware, as they build and assemble racks full of audio visual equipment that usually sits a closet that connects all the pieces needed to run properly together. Cenero uses CAD software to develop drawings for their installation jobs. These drawings show a rudimentary version of how the cable needs to be pulled, connected, and labeled. These drawings also have dimensions on exactly how high to mount screens, speakers, and other forms of technology that needs to be mounted like cameras. Cenero also uses Internet Technologies by using a network of computers, terminal servers, routers, and a multicasting device so it certsinly utilizes Internet Technologies.

    <p> Cenero also does a great job of networking, programming, and using data bases to continue pushing the limits of audio visual technology. All of the computers are linked and can operate interactively with one another. A program used very often is is microsoft teams, but all of the company computers are linked to one another. Cenero has it's own programming team that gets sent all of the equipment that has been prepped and staged. These programmers then configure the devices like the cameras, speakers, and microphones to one another. They also make sure that everything is functing properly before sending them to the job site. Cenero uses databases by storing important information on technology issues, important contacts globally so that they can subcontract their international jobs. They also use their databases to help with the sales aspect in the company.</p>
    
    <h2>Install Technician</h2>
    <p>Located in Malvern, PA as an install technician you tend to be all over the PA, DE, and NJ area. The average salary of an install tech is $40,151 in Pennsylvania. To be an Install Technician there are certainly a few skill reuiorements needed. I personally am interning at Cenero as a Install Tech. You need a very good understanding of audio and visual equipment. You need to be able to work with power tools. You need excellent troubleshooting skills, and being able to terminate cables is crucial in that position. Being able to read and understand blueprints is also critical. To become an install technician you need a high school degree, and if you really do not have any understanding of AV before becoming a technician, most employers will offer onsite training.

    Video walls are a rather new yet extremely interesting form of technology. The one shown is an 1000" video wall that is 36 feet wide and 70 feet high in Charlotte, North Carolina. These video walls can contain custom artwork, content roadmap planning, and content maagerial services. These video walls have a complex algorithim.

        In the future the whole idea of a conference room sounds slightly skeptical ever since the covid outbreak, it became much more accessible and easier to work from home because of the outbreak. This being said in the future I would assume that most conference calls in the future will continue to be virtual rather than in person, because lots of people work from home now.

    <p>In cocnlusion, audio visual technology is extremely interesting and there are so many possible oppurtunites that come within the field. Understanding how all of your technology is working and connected to one another can be extremely helpful as technology continues to become more and more prevalent in todays society. </p>
